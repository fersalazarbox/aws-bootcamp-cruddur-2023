# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


We are developing Cruddur, a microblogging platform that will be similar to Twitter. The project is expected to take approximately 14 weeks to complete.

During the first week (actually the zero one), We integrated Gitpod with VSCode, set up the AWS CLI, and automated Gitpod workspaces to ensure the CLI is installed with every new workspace. 

We created flowcharts of the application using LucidChart, which was a great experience.

## Required Tasks:

- Completed all the required tasks.

### Cloud governace, IAM
