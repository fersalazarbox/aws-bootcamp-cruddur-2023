# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


We are developing Cruddur, a microblogging platform that will be similar to Twitter. The project is expected to take approximately 14 weeks to complete.

During the bootcamp's first week, I learned about billing and architecture on AWS. I discovered that pricing can vary between regions, and that there are several tools available for monitoring and managing costs. For instance, I can use the billing dashboard to see my monthly resource usage and costs, set up free-tier monitoring, and create cost allocation tags to track expenses across resources.

In terms of security, I learned about the importance of protecting data within cloud-hosted applications, and the risks associated with an AWS account compromise. To help mitigate these risks, I explored several AWS services such as AWS Organizations, which allows for account segregation and helps with managing security and billing. I also learned about AWS CloudTrail, a monitoring tool that can log and track most activities and API calls within my AWS account.

I completed several assignments during the week, including creating an admin user, installing the AWS CLI, and creating a billing alarm and budget. I also worked on some required homework such as recreating a conceptual and logical architectural diagram, enabling MFA for both my root and IAM users, and setting up AWS CLI environment variables.

Overall, I found the first week of the bootcamp to be both challenging and rewarding. I gained a better understanding of AWS billing and security best practices, and I am excited to continue learning and building on these foundations in the weeks to come.

During my first week in the bootcamp, I accomplished several tasks related to preparing for cloud engineering on AWS. I gained a thorough understanding of billing and architecture in AWS, which involved learning about the pricing differences between regions, and how to monitor and manage costs. For instance, I created cost allocation tags to track expenses across resources and set up free-tier monitoring.

I also learned about security practices in AWS and how to protect data within cloud-hosted applications. I discovered the importance of an AWS account compromise and explored several services to mitigate the risks. These services include AWS Organizations, which allows for account segregation and helps with managing security and billing, and AWS CloudTrail, a monitoring tool that can log and track most activities and API calls within my AWS account.

I completed several assignments, including developing a logical CI/CD pipeline flow for the CRUDDUR application and creating an admin user. I also recreated conceptual and logical diagrams using LucidChart and set up AWS CLI environment variables.

For me, the most important lesson was understanding how to propose high-level solutions and approaches for projects to decision-makers. I realized that it is crucial to understand business objectives and to present viable solutions that will achieve the desired outcomes.

Overall, the foundational tasks related to billing, security, and architecture that I learned during the first week will be instrumental in my journey towards becoming a proficient cloud engineer on AWS. I am excited to continue building on these foundations in the coming weeks.


## Required Tasks:

- Completed all the required tasks.

### Cloud governace, IAM

Following best practice and using IAM user with admin and billing policies attached instead of root account. MFA enabled for user account.

### Conceptual Flow

High level Architecture design for all stakeholders.

## Obstacles:

I found to navigate through bash console it was my first time getting hands on this, also I got problems installing AWS on windows but finally I could manage it.
