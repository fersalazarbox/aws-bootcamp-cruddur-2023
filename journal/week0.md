# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


We are developing Cruddur, a microblogging platform that will be similar to Twitter. 
The project is expected to take approximately 14 weeks to complete. 
During the first week (actually the zero one), I integrated Gitpod and VSCode, set up the AWS CLI, and automated Gitpod workspaces to ensure the CLI is installed with every new workspace. 
In addition, I created a flowchart of the application using LucidChart, which was a great experience.
